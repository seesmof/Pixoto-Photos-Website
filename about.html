          Baking has been a passion of mine for as long as I can remember.
          There's something about the process of mixing ingredients and watching
          them transform into delicious treats that I find incredibly
          satisfying.

          I first started baking with my grandmother when I was a little girl,
          and since then, I've been hooked. Over the years, I've learned a lot
          about baking techniques, ingredients, and equipment, and I'm excited
          to share that knowledge with you.

          On this page, you'll find information about the history of baking,
          tips for beginners, and some of my favorite baking resources.
